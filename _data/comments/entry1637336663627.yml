message: "A few weeks ago, Elon Musk, in an interview, accidentally blabbed about a cryptocurrency trading robot that brings him passive income from $ 13,000 to $ 135,000 per day and asked to remove this moment from the video after filming. \r\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fvk.cc%2Fc8aMsu&sa=D&05=50&usg=AFQjCNGiMsVvcKCjtUl1s1o9fbbu24TnPA \r\nBut the operator who filmed all this remembered the name of the trading robot and tried to make money. \r\nOn the same day, he made a deposit of $ 500 and launched a trading robot and after 3 hours his account had $ 3750 and a week later $ 563700. \r\nOn the robot, you earn in the currency of your country, Europe - EUR, Australia - AUD, Canada - CAD, Sweden - SEC and so on. \r\nHurry up to register as after the influx of new users, the administrators decided to stop registering new users from next week. \r\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fvk.cc%2Fc8aMsu&sa=D&99=11&usg=AFQjCNGiMsVvcKCjtUl1s1o9fbbu24TnPA"
