message: "Good day! \r\n \r\nWe will send viacontact forms to the sites of firms via any domain zones of the world.  \r\n \r\nwebsite =» xn----7sbb1bbndheurc1a.xn--p1ai \r\n \r\nWHAT IS THE MAILING OF SITES BY FEEDBACK FORMS? \r\nThis is a type of mailing using the contact forms that are located in the feedback section of the website and filled by our robot in a preset mode with a rate of a few thousand feedback forms per one minute, while the alphabetic and numeric code from the pictures (captcha) is also solved. \r\nAfter that, the messages including your cooperation offers are sent to the mailboxes of companies. \r\nWhen sending mailing by contact feedback forms, it turns out that each internet resource sends an e-mail “to itself” and, therefore, all letters arrive in the inbox folder of the exact mailbox in which the company is ready to receive the business information. \r\n \r\nUTP: \r\nFast 100-percent informing of firms and website owners about new commercial offers. \r\nSearch of new customers that other types of advertisements cannot find. \r\n \r\nAIM: \r\nFinding customers that cannot be found through other types of advertisements. \r\n \r\nBenefits: \r\n1.one hundred percent delivery of commercial offers. \r\n2.Increase of the client database. \r\n3.

Entering the international markets. \r\n \r\nCompetitive advantages: \r\n1.When sending mailing by contact forms, all e-mails arrive in the inbox folder. When sending e-mail newsletters, this can reach up to five percent. \r\n \r\n2.When sending mailing by contact forms it is possible to send a few million e-mails per 24 hours to inbox folders. When sending e-mail newsletters a few thousands arrive in the inbox folders, all the rest often either do not reach or fill the spam. \r\n \r\n3. When sending mailing by feedback forms a letter does not get blocked by mail systems because it is sent from different sites. When sending e-newsletters it is possible to send a few thousands of those but nevertheless all the IP addresses from which the mailing is sent will be blocked. \r\n \r\n4. When sending mailing by feedback forms the minimum number of macros is used to form headings and text of the letter. When sending bulk e-mails, it is necessary to use «macros» (synonyms) for each phrase and create ten thousand different headings. \r\n \r\n5. Many organisations deliberatelly hide their e-mail and only leave a contact form for contacting with them. \r\n \r\n6. When sending e-mail newsletters, your business offer is delivered to every employee of the business, (which causes discontent) compared to mailing by contact forms where the letter is received at the email specifically set up for  cooperation  offers. \r\n \r\n7.50% of business e-mail addresses are placed on free mail servers, they are not very \"searchable\" by e-mail, but when sending mailing by contact forms through these mail systems, all messages are 100-percent delivered to the recipients. \r\n \r\n8. Only 30%-40% of companies are placed in the directories within several years, and all the rest are already placed in our WHOIS databases and are waiting for your commercial offers. \r\nIt turns out that that e-mails of organisations from directories are spammed, which means that they will not have such profit as when sending mailing by feedback forms using our new VOIS databases. \r\n \r\n9. Any kind of stop words in the body or headings of the message can be sent through contact forms. When sending e-newsletters, such messages either do not reach the recipient or end up in spam. \r\nThe list of stop words of mail systems includes almost all phrases and words that encourage your potential customers to take active actions. \r\n \r\nApplication: \r\n \r\n1. Searching for new clients. \r\n2. Quick notification of marketplaces about new cooperation offers. \r\n3. Accessing directors. \r\n4.Testing the demand for products and services. \r\n5.

Full geographical coverage for all states of the world. \r\n \r\n7. We offer customers that are not available through other types of advertisement. \r\nWhen sending mailing by feedback forms, you will be able to reach out that part of your potential customers, that are impossible to find in automatic mode in any other way. \r\nFor instance, you will be able to deliver a business offer to those potential customers that were previously out of reach due to e-mail filters while sending bulk e-mails. \r\nIn the markets, there is a paradoxical situation: firms in the directories are literally spammed with all sorts of business offers while very little or no e-mails are sent to the rest. \r\n \r\n8. Unique technique of decrypting the captcha. \r\nThere are services for unraveling numeric and alphabetic code (captcha/CAPTCHA).

This e-mail is also set up for cell phones as it is necessary to respond to the information instantly so as not to misplace the application or the relevance of the cooperation offer. \r\n \r\n11. The database of countries also includes all joint businesses from all countries of the world closely related to or working with this country, for instance, national communities and diasporas. \r\nSanctions of mail systems and search engines? \r\nThese mailings are an alternative to sending e-newsletters, therefore search sanctions and \"Ban\" do not apply to them. \r\nMail service delivers the data of e-mails to the inbox folder, as it passes through the \"warm channel\" from the new IP address of the site to the corporate e-mail address of the same website. \r\nSimply speaking, these mailings \"live in e-mails\" and e-mail filters do not react to them, because mail systems have trust in communication channels between sites and corporate mailboxes. \r\n \r\nOUR DATABASES: \r\nYou can buy our databases separately from the mailing by sending us a enquiry by contact form. \r\n \r\nMORE THAN 2000 VOIS DATABASES BY DOMAIN ZONES AND COUNTRIES. \r\n \r\nCOLLECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN CONTINENTS OF THE WORLD. \r\n \r\nCOLLECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN WORLD LANGUAGES. \r\n \r\nSELECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN CMS. \r\n \r\nCOLLECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD. \r\n \r\nHOW TO MAKE AN PROMOTIONAL OFFER FOR MAILING BY FEEDBACK FORMS: \r\nThe simplest text of the message + headings, the main goal is to interest the potential customer, and they will read the rest on your site. \r\nMost likely, all ads on your subject are already on the Internet, enter the necessary requests into the search engine and choose the most suitable ones. \r\nThe headings are substituted by a carousel from .txt file. \r\nOnly messages in the text form are sent, links are inserted without problems, they are active.
