When sending e-newsletters, this can reach up to 5%. \r\n \r\n2.When sending mailing by contact forms it is possible to send a few million letters per day to inboxes. When sending e-newsletters a few thousands arrive in the inbox folders, all the remaining ones often either do not reach or fill the spam. \r\n \r\n3. When sending mailing by contact forms an e-mail does not get blocked by mail systems because it is sent from different internet resources. When sending bulk e-mails it is possible to send a few thousands of those but nevertheless all the IP addresses from which the mailing is sent will be in \"BAN\". \r\n \r\n4. When sending mailing by feedback forms the very little amount of macros is used to form headings and text of the letter. When sending bulk e-mails, it is necessary to use «macros» (synonyms) for each phrase and create thousands different headings. \r\n \r\n5. Many companies try to hide their mailbox and only leave a contact form for contacting with them. \r\n \r\n6. When sending e-newsletters, your commercial offer is delivered to every employee of the company, (which causes discontent) compared to mailing by contact forms where the message is received at the e-mail specifically set up for business offers. \r\n \r\n7.half of business e-mail addresses are located on free mail servers, they are not very \"searchable\" by email, but when sending mailing by feedback forms through these mail systems, all letters are 100% delivered to the recipients. \r\n \r\n8. Only thirty-forty percent of firms are published in the directories within two-three years, and the rest are already located in our WHOIS databases and are waiting for your business offers. \r\nIt turns out that that emails of organisations from directories are full of spam, and therefore they will not have such monetisation as when sending mailing by feedback forms using our always new WHOIS databases. \r\n \r\n9. Any kind of stop words in the body or headings of the message can be sent through forms. When sending bulk e-mails, such messages either are not delivered the recipient or arrive in junk. \r\nThe list of stop words of mail systems includes almost all words and phrases that encourage your potential customers to take active actions. \r\n \r\nApplication: \r\n \r\n1. Searching for new clients. \r\n2. Quick informing of marketplaces about new cooperation offers. \r\n3. Reaching out company officials. \r\n4.Testing the demand for products and services. \r\n5.
